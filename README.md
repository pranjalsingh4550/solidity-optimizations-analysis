### Test Suite for Ethereum Smart Contract Optimization Tools

This repository contains the test suite created to execute and verify the features of Solidity Smart Contract Tools and Solidity Compiler Optimizer.

Done as a part of the CS738 course project (Advanced Compiler Optimizations) at IIT Kanpur in 2023-24 II semester.

Done by Sabari M, Moinuddin and Pranjal Singh under the guidance of Prof Amey Karkare.

#### Directory Structure

The repository consists of directories each of which corresponds to individual components/tools which we had evaluated as part of our survey. Each of the directories would be having its own corresponding README files along with some sample code containing instructions regarding how to execute them.

As part of our Survey we have evaluated the following:
1. Tools:
    > Rattle
    
	> Porosity

    > Manticore

    > Echidna

    > Gasol

2. The Optimizer : the inbuilt optimizer available within the latest versions of Solidity Compiler
