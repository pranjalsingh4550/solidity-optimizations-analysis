control-flow-reduntant-memory-ops.ir:
array[10] = 0x17500 is unnecessary, but is present in IR and bytecode

algebraic-simplifications.ir:
LLVM would convert the two +1s into one +2, not Solidity
checked_mul_int256_1043(): unnecessary checks for (x != 0) in multiply-by-1
no pair of operations is merged
duplicate functions are merged

data-flow-inequalities-removal.ir:
(val < 0x7000) is not evaluated twice, but `if expr {}` is used inside the bigger `if expr {}` block!

(val == 0x7000) is computed separately. No other optimization to avoid/run any of the inner
if blocks separately.

Redundant loads are removed from the point before the unconditional store inside the outer if-block.
Loads before an if-(unconditional else) are also removed.

unnecessary-overflow-checks.ir:

In the second if block, overflow checking is not done
In the third block, overflow may happen and it is checked
